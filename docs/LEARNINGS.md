# Learnings

## 2026-05-08: README should stay user-facing

The README is now intentionally a concise onboarding and common-task guide
rather than a complete manual. Keep OpenAPI contract details in
`docs/API_COVERAGE.md`, generated public surface details in
`docs/API_REFERENCE.md`, advanced runtime topics in `docs/ADVANCED.md`, DKIM DNS
walkthroughs in `docs/DKIM.md`, and maintainer workflows in
`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`. This keeps package users on the shortest path from
installing the SDK to sending production email while preserving deeper details
for readers who need them.

## 2026-05-08: API reference value exports need explicit summaries

The API reference generator can derive summaries from module, class, function,
TypedDict, and Pydantic docstrings, but plain values, constants, and type
aliases often have no runtime docstring. Keep `SUMMARY_OVERRIDES` in
`scripts/generate_api_reference.py` updated for those exports so generated API
reference sections never contain blank `Summary:` fields.

## 2026-04-24: SDK starts as a greenfield package

The repository currently contains only project instructions, so the SDK can be
structured from first principles around MailChannels Email API behavior rather
than preserving an existing implementation. The first implementation should make
`/send-async` and sub-account operations first-class because those are
MailChannels-specific differentiators rather than secondary endpoints.

## 2026-04-24: uv pytest is not a native uv command

The current uv CLI rejects `uv pytest` as an unknown subcommand. The SDK uses
the portable pytest harness `uv run pytest` instead. SmolVM tests can run by
copying a tar archive of the working tree into a Python VM because direct
SmolVM bind mounts appeared empty in this macOS sandbox.

## 2026-04-24: Templates and unsubscribe are send payload fields

MailChannels templates and unsubscribe behavior are not separate CRUD resources.
Templates are expressed through `content[].template_type = "mustache"` and
`personalizations[].dynamic_template_data`. Unsubscribe links use the
`{{mc-unsubscribe-url}}` mustache placeholder, while automatic
List-Unsubscribe headers are enabled by setting the root send field
`transactional` to `false`. MailChannels documents that List-Unsubscribe also
requires one recipient per personalization and DKIM signing.

## 2026-04-24: Metrics are GET resources under /metrics

The Metrics API has five documented endpoint categories: engagement,
performance, recipient behaviour, volume, and sender metrics. Time-series
endpoints share `start_time`, `end_time`, `campaign_id`, and `interval` query
parameters. Sender metrics use `/metrics/senders/{sender_type}` where
`sender_type` is `campaigns` or `sub-accounts`, with `limit`, `offset`, and
`sort_order` query parameters.

## 2026-04-24: Custom headers are send payload fields

MailChannels custom email headers are expressed through the `headers` object in
the send payload. The same `headers` field is valid inside each personalization
for recipient-specific headers. If the same header exists in both places,
MailChannels uses the personalization-level value.

## 2026-04-24: DKIM has both key-management and send-payload support

MailChannels supports customer-managed DKIM private keys in send payloads and
MailChannels-hosted private keys through `/domains/{domain}/dkim-keys`.
MailChannels returns suggested DKIM DNS records from key-management endpoints,
but the customer must still publish the public DKIM TXT record in their own DNS
zone because MailChannels does not host public DKIM records for customer
domains yet.

## 2026-04-24: Resend comparison highlights SDK ergonomics

The local `../resend-python` comparison produced SDK-level improvements rather
than MailChannels API changes: environment variable configuration, response
headers, attribute-style responses, async parity, webhook resources, and
suppression-list resources are all valuable alignment points. MailChannels
webhooks are signed with `Content-Digest`, `Signature-Input`, and `Signature`;
the SDK can safely provide digest and metadata helpers while leaving final
RFC 9421 Ed25519 verification to a dedicated HTTP-signature library.

## 2026-04-24: Parent usage and pagination share common query helpers

MailChannels exposes both parent-account `/usage` and sub-account
`/sub-account/{handle}/usage`; the SDK now models the parent endpoint as
`Usage` while keeping sub-account usage under `SubAccounts`. Paginated endpoints
share `compact_query()` and `pagination_query()` so date serialization,
comma-separated list serialization, and `limit`/`offset` handling do not drift
between resources.

## 2026-04-24: Attachment ergonomics are local payload helpers

MailChannels attachments are still ordinary send-payload fields, but the SDK can
make them much easier to construct. `Attachment.from_file()`,
`Attachment.from_bytes()`, `Attachment.from_url()`, and
`Attachment.inline_file()` keep Base64 encoding, remote retrieval, MIME
inference, inline disposition, and `content_id` handling close to the attachment
model without adding an API resource that MailChannels does not have.

## 2026-04-24: Version and transports are now explicit SDK contracts

The SDK exports `__version__` and `get_version()` and derives the User-Agent
from that version value, so future releases only need one version source.
Custom HTTP clients are modeled as `SyncHTTPClient` and `AsyncHTTPClient`
protocols returning `SDKResponse`; module-level `default_http_client` and
`default_async_http_client` now accept protocol-compatible transports instead
of only the built-in requests/httpx wrapper classes.

## 2026-04-24: Examples should be importable and tested

The SDK examples now expose small functions for async sending, attachments,
suppressions, webhooks, usage, custom HTTP clients, and structured error
handling. This keeps examples useful as documentation while allowing tests to
exercise them with fake transports and no real network calls.

## 2026-04-24: Exceptions carry support-ready metadata

MailChannels errors now preserve response headers and derive request IDs,
retry-after hints, error types, suggested actions, and `to_dict()` metadata.
This makes example error handling and production logging more useful without
forcing callers to parse raw HTTP responses.

## 2026-04-24: Online tests are explicit and non-delivering by default

Live MailChannels API tests use the `online` pytest marker, require a real
`MAILCHANNELS_API_KEY`, and also require the `--online` flag so local test runs
do not accidentally call production APIs. Online send validation uses
`dry_run=True` and only runs when `MAILCHANNELS_ONLINE_FROM` and
`MAILCHANNELS_ONLINE_TO` are set.

## 2026-04-24: Live API 5xx responses should not look like SDK regressions

The live `/usage` endpoint can return HTTP 500 with a JSON `null` body. Online
tests now report live MailChannels 5xx responses as `xfail`, while preserving
normal failures for 4xx/auth/validation issues. The SDK also avoids surfacing
`null` as an exception message and falls back to a status-based message instead.
Live endpoint timeouts are also external service conditions for online tests,
so they are reported as `xfail` rather than SDK regressions.

## 2026-04-25: Real-send online tests need a second explicit opt-in

Online tests now cover more live read-only endpoints plus dry-run sending. The
test that actually sends an email is intentionally gated behind
`MAILCHANNELS_ONLINE_SEND_REAL=1`, in addition to `MAILCHANNELS_API_KEY`,
`MAILCHANNELS_ONLINE_FROM`, `MAILCHANNELS_ONLINE_TO`, and `--online`, so broad
online test runs do not deliver mail accidentally.

## 2026-04-25: Online metrics tests should use bounded windows

The live `/metrics/volume?interval=day` query can time out when no time range is
provided. The online volume metrics test now sends an explicit recent 24-hour
UTC `start_time` and `end_time` range so it still exercises the endpoint without
depending on the service to infer an unbounded query window. MailChannels bug
`CLOUD-5801` tracks the timeout issue in the metrics API.

## 2026-04-25: CI mirrors local quality gates

The repository now has a GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs pytest on Python
3.9 and 3.13, plus ruff, mypy, and package builds on Python 3.13. Live API tests
belong in a separate manual-only workflow because they require a real
MailChannels API key and may optionally deliver a real email.

## 2026-04-25: SmolVM archives should exclude local tool caches

After adding mypy, the local archive used for SmolVM verification ballooned when
it included `.mypy_cache` and other tool caches, which made VM extraction noisy
and slow. Build SmolVM tarballs with `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1` and exclude `.venv`,
`.git`, `dist`, `.mypy_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, and `.pytest_cache`.

## 2026-04-25: GitHub Actions should use Node 24-ready actions

GitHub CI warned that Node.js 20 actions are deprecated. The workflows now use
`actions/checkout@v6`, `actions/setup-python@v6`, and
`astral-sh/setup-uv@v8.1.0`, which declare the Node 24 runtime and avoid the
deprecation warning without adding a temporary compatibility environment flag.
`setup-uv` caching is disabled because the jobs are fast and parallel cache
saves can produce noisy "Unable to reserve cache" annotations.

## 2026-04-25: Wishlist now prioritizes API conformance

The SDK wishlist has shifted from Resend-alignment ergonomics to MailChannels API
conformance. The highest-priority work is correcting sub-account limit routes,
adding `/check-domain`, and introducing OpenAPI-backed contract tests and drift
detection so hand-written SDK routes cannot silently diverge from the official
specification.

## 2026-04-25: Sub-account limits use singular `/limit`

The official OpenAPI spec defines sub-account limits as
`/sub-account/{handle}/limit`, with `PUT` for setting limits and a `sends`
request body. The SDK previously used plural `/limits` and `POST`; it now emits
the documented route, method, and payload while keeping `monthly_limit` as a
compatibility alias for existing callers.

## 2026-04-25: `/check-domain` covers authentication setup

MailChannels' `/check-domain` endpoint validates DKIM, SPF, sender-domain DNS,
and Domain Lockdown status for a sending domain. The SDK models it as
`DomainChecks` so DKIM key management remains separate from broader domain
configuration validation.

## 2026-04-25: SDK routes are now checked against OpenAPI

Supported SDK endpoints are declared in `src/mailchannels/routes.py`. The
OpenAPI drift checker compares those method/path pairs with the official
MailChannels OpenAPI spec and runs in CI as a separate job. This should catch
future route drift like the earlier sub-account `/limits` versus `/limit`
mistake before it lands.

## 2026-04-25: `/check-domain` needs a discoverable SDK name

The first implementation exposed `/check-domain` as `DomainChecks`, but users
reviewing API coverage naturally look for the documented endpoint spelling.
Expose `CheckDomain` and `client.check_domain` as first-class aliases while
keeping `DomainChecks` and `client.domain_checks` for compatibility.

## 2026-04-25: API coverage needs obvious public signposts

Even when route support exists, reviewers scan the README introduction and test
filenames first. Keep API coverage summarized near the top of README and keep a
plainly named `tests/test_openapi_contract.py` alongside the live OpenAPI drift
script so contract coverage is visible from the repository tree.

## 2026-04-25: README organization should follow reader intent

For SDK documentation, a long feature list is harder to absorb than a reader
path. Keep the README organized around quickstart, core concepts, sending
recipes, account/domain operations, and production operations. Put MailChannels'
multi-tenant isolation story in the introduction because it is a core product
distinction, not an advanced footnote.

## 2026-04-25: Strict responses should be opt-in

Typed response models improve trust and catch API drift, but returning Pydantic
models by default would break the SDK's existing dict-like ergonomics. Keep the
default response shape stable and expose `strict_responses=True` for callers who
want end-to-end response validation and typed model returns.

## 2026-04-25: OpenAPI route drift checks should be bidirectional

Checking only whether SDK routes exist in OpenAPI misses newly documented API
endpoints. Keep `scripts/check_openapi_drift.py` symmetric: fail when SDK routes
drop out of the spec and when spec routes are missing from the SDK route
registry, so OpenAPI additions create visible SDK work.

## 2026-04-25: Route coverage also needs executable request contracts

Method/path snapshots catch route drift, but they do not catch request-shape
regressions. Keep an every-route contract matrix that calls the public SDK
surface through a fake transport and validates the generated method, concrete
path, JSON keys, query keys, and operation-specific headers. This catches
subtle regressions such as legacy payload names or auth headers on public
webhook-key operations.

## 2026-04-25: Sync and async operations should share contract rows

Async methods can drift from sync methods even when route-level coverage passes.
Keep sync and async calls in the same operation contract row and compare the
captured fake-transport requests directly. This keeps parity checks tied to the
same concrete inputs used for OpenAPI request-shape validation.

## 2026-04-25: PyPI releases should use trusted publishing

Release automation should not depend on long-lived PyPI API tokens. Use a
separate GitHub Actions workflow with a build-and-verify job and a narrowly
permissioned publish job that grants `id-token: write` only when uploading to
PyPI through the `pypi` environment.

## 2026-04-25: Fake transports are not enough transport coverage

Resource tests use fake transports well, but the real `RequestsClient` and
`HTTPXClient` wrappers still need direct tests. Lock down argument forwarding,
configured timeouts, non-JSON response handling, header preservation, and the
missing-`httpx` configuration error so production transport regressions are not
hidden by fake-client tests.

## 2026-04-25: Error mapping tests should cover metadata extraction

Status-to-exception tests should verify more than exception class names. Keep
coverage for stable `error_type`, message extraction from structured fields and
plain text, empty-body fallback messages, retry headers, and common request ID
header variants.

## 2026-04-25: Destructive online tests need a separate opt-in

Live CRUD tests are useful but must not run with the normal read-only online
suite. Gate destructive tests behind the `online_destructive` marker, the
`--online-destructive` pytest option, and `MAILCHANNELS_ONLINE_DESTRUCTIVE=1`.
Run them only against a dedicated test account because webhook cleanup uses the
API's delete-all webhook endpoint.

## 2026-04-25: Webhook verification should fail closed

Webhook helper tests should cover malformed and missing signature metadata, not
only valid examples. Invalid or non-base64 `Content-Digest` values should return
`False` without raising, header lookup should be case-insensitive, and missing
or stale signature timestamps should not be treated as fresh.

## 2026-04-25: Public typing needs a consumer fixture

Internal mypy checks do not prove that exported SDK names type-check in a user
project. Keep a small `typing_tests/` fixture that imports public names from the
installed-style package surface and runs mypy in strict mode so aliasing,
Pydantic model constructors, and exported helpers do not drift unnoticed.

## 2026-04-25: Build success is not install success

`uv build` verifies that an artifact can be produced, but not that users can
install and import it. Keep a wheel smoke script that installs the built wheel
into clean environments, checks `mailchannels/py.typed`, verifies base sync
imports without the async extra, and verifies the `[async]` extra brings in
`httpx`.

## 2026-04-25: Start coverage enforcement below current measured coverage

Branch coverage measured 88% after the current conformance and transport test
work. Start `coverage.py` enforcement at 85% so CI catches meaningful drops
without making low-value proxy-method gaps block unrelated work. Ratchet the
threshold upward after adding tests for the remaining module-level proxies and
optional branches.

## 2026-04-26: README snippets need executable coverage

README code fences are a public API surface. Extracting and running safe Python
snippets with fake transports caught a real drift bug where a custom-header
example put `subject` only inside a personalization, while the SDK requires a
root-level subject. Keep external-integration snippets compile-only or
explicitly skipped, but make ordinary SDK examples execute in tests.

## 2026-04-26: Keep API errors catch-compatible

Narrower API exceptions should inherit from `ApiError`, not just
`MailChannelsError`. That lets users catch `RateLimitError`,
`InvalidRequestError`, or `ServerError` directly without breaking existing
`except ApiError` handlers in online tests and production integrations.

## 2026-04-26: Focused examples should isolate external services

Examples for SDK behavior should expose small helper functions that accept a
`Client` and avoid network work at import time. External-service examples, such
as Cloudflare DKIM DNS publication, should accept a minimal protocol-shaped
client so tests can verify create/update behavior without installing or calling
the external service.

## 2026-04-26: Keep the wishlist active

The wishlist is more useful when it is an active roadmap, not a changelog. Move
implemented items into a short completed-foundation summary and keep the
prioritized list limited to work that still needs a decision or implementation.

## 2026-04-26: API coverage reports should include provenance

Endpoint coverage is most useful when readers can tell exactly which OpenAPI
document it targets. Include the OpenAPI source URL, spec version, SHA-256 hash,
generated timestamp, and SDK version in `docs/API_COVERAGE.md` so drift reports
and release notes can point to a concrete contract.

## 2026-04-26: Strict response tests need the full modeled surface

Strict response mode is only reliable if the modeled SDK response surface has
executable coverage. Keep `tests/test_response_config.py` aligned with the
resource methods and response models: valid API bodies should return the
expected Pydantic model, headers must survive as `http_headers`, extra API
fields should remain forward-compatible, and stable required fields or types
should raise `ResponseValidationError` when the API shape drifts.

## 2026-04-26: Email negative tests should cover SDK and API boundaries

Some malformed send payloads should never reach HTTP, while raw API payloads are
still useful for proving MailChannels rejects invalid shapes consistently. Keep
local validation tests beside mocked raw-API rejection tests, and mark the live
dry-run rejection matrix as `online` so maintainers can verify the same
negative cases against the real `/send?dry-run=true` endpoint without
delivering mail.

## 2026-04-26: API reference generation should be deterministic

Public API reference docs are most useful when they are generated from source
without timestamps or network access. Keep `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` derived from
`mailchannels.__all__`, subpackage `__all__` declarations, docstrings, method
signatures, Pydantic model fields, and TypedDict annotations so review diffs
show real public surface changes instead of regenerated noise.

## 2026-04-27: Do not evaluate TypedDict annotations in docs generation

Python 3.9 and 3.10 can fail when `typing.get_type_hints()` evaluates postponed
annotations that contain newer union syntax mixing built-in generics and
TypedDicts. The API reference generator should render raw TypedDict
`__annotations__` instead. Documentation does not need runtime-resolved types,
and avoiding evaluation keeps generated docs compatible across the CI matrix.

## 2026-05-07: Strict send responses need variant validation

MailChannels `/send` has two successful response shapes: normal sends return a
request ID with per-personalization send results, while dry-run sends return
rendered message data. `/send-async` returns a request ID and queue timestamp.
Strict response mode should validate these variants explicitly so `{}` and
other unmodeled response bodies do not pass on the SDK's primary endpoints.

## 2026-05-07: Default transports should pool connections

The SDK's default transports should be reusable resources, not per-request
wrappers. `RequestsClient` owns one `requests.Session`, and `HTTPXClient`
lazily creates one `httpx.AsyncClient` so sync-only installs still work without
the async extra. Explicit `close()` and `aclose()` hooks, plus sync and async
client context managers, make lifecycle management visible to applications and
tests.

## 2026-05-07: Strict response typing needs client-level literals

Mypy can infer `Client[Literal[True]]` from `Client(strict_responses=True)` when
the constructor is overloaded. Resource objects should carry the same strictness
literal and overload modeled methods so explicit strict clients return Pydantic
models statically, while non-strict clients keep the dict-like
`MailChannelsResponse`. Module-level helpers should remain broader because
`mailchannels.strict_responses` is mutable runtime state.

## 2026-05-07: Webhook verification should cover digest and signature

`Content-Digest` verification proves body integrity but not authenticity. The
high-level webhook receiver path should use `Webhooks.verify(...)` or
`verify_webhook_signature(...)` so the SDK checks the digest, signature
freshness, and the RFC 9421 Ed25519 `Signature` value against the public key
returned by `/webhook/public-key`. Keep the lower-level helpers for diagnostics
and custom verification flows.

## 2026-05-07: Webhook freshness must be directional

Replay windows should not treat future timestamps like stale timestamps.
`signature_is_fresh(...)`, `verify_webhook_signature(...)`, and
`Webhooks.verify(...)` now use separate `max_age_seconds` and `max_skew_seconds`
windows. Keep `tolerance_seconds` only as a compatibility alias for stale-age
tolerance.

## 2026-05-07: Intentional destructive operations are info-level logs

Delete, suspend, rotate, resend, and similar user-requested operations are
normal SDK activity, even when destructive. Log them at info level and reserve
warning for unexpected recoverable states such as missing webhook signature
metadata, malformed webhook headers, or optional dependency fallbacks.

## 2026-05-07: Generic aliases need stable docs rendering

Python versions can disagree about whether built-in generic aliases such as
`dict[str, str]` look class-like to `inspect.isclass()`. The API reference
generator should classify these aliases before regular class introspection so
exports such as `EmailHeaders` stay rendered as simple values without inheriting
the built-in `dict` docstring or a synthetic `(*args, **kwargs)` signature.

## 2026-05-07: SKILLS.md should stay focused on SDK usage

`SKILLS.md` is guidance for AI agents consuming the MailChannels Python SDK, not
a repository contributor playbook. Keep maintenance procedures, test workflows,
release notes, and implementation chores out of that file unless they directly
teach correct SDK usage.

## 2026-05-07: API reference annotations must be version-normalized

Python 3.9 can expose Pydantic field annotations as evaluated `Optional[...]`,
detailed `Literal[...]`, unqualified model classes, or bare containers where
newer Python versions preserve newer syntax and generic details. Render
Pydantic fields from raw source `__annotations__`, not `field.annotation`, and
test the snapshot under Python 3.9 and 3.10 before assuming the reference is
stable.

## 2026-05-08: API spec compatibility should be runtime-visible

Coverage reports are useful before release, but installed packages also need a
network-free way to report which MailChannels OpenAPI document they target.
Expose an immutable `mailchannels.API_SPEC_COMPATIBILITY` value with the spec
source URL, OpenAPI version, SHA-256 hash, checked timestamp, and SDK version so
applications can include that contract metadata in diagnostics and support
logs.
