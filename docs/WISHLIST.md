# SDK Wishlist

This wishlist is the active roadmap for the MailChannels Python SDK. Completed
items have been removed from the active queue so this file stays useful for
choosing the next engineering task.

## Recommended Order

1. Explore OpenAPI-assisted generation
2. Add request options if the API exposes per-request controls

## 1. Explore OpenAPI-Assisted Generation

Investigate generating selected SDK artifacts from the MailChannels OpenAPI
spec. A fully generated SDK may not be the right product design, but generated
route declarations, operation metadata, request-shape tests, response-model
stubs, or coverage reports could reduce human error while preserving the
hand-written ergonomic SDK surface.

Keep this exploratory until the coverage report and strict response tests make
the desired generated artifacts obvious.

Priority: medium.

## 2. Add Request Options If Needed

If MailChannels exposes per-request option headers such as idempotency keys,
model them as an `options` argument rather than forcing those controls into
payloads.

Do not build this speculatively. Add it only when there is a concrete
MailChannels API need or documented per-request option.

Priority: low.

## Other Cleanup Candidates

- Remove or handle dead branches in `raise_for_status` for 1xx and 3xx
  responses.
- Split SDK payload validation errors from Pydantic validation errors with a
  more specific exception or richer error details.
- Document that `Webhooks.resend_batch` is unauthenticated and identified only
  by `X-Customer-Handle`.
- Simplify `limit_payload` dead paths and make the `monthly_limit` alias
  decision explicit.
- Add an async attachment fetch helper or document that `Attachment.from_url`
  blocks the event loop.
- Reduce sender alias sprawl by documenting `from_` as canonical and treating
  the other aliases as compatibility paths.
- Rename underscore-prefixed sub-account proxy classes or hide them behind a
  clearer namespace.
- Preserve typing in `Suppressions.list(**kwargs)`.
- Decide whether the US-spelling metrics alias should be unique or part of a
  broader spelling-compatibility policy.
- Audit metrics response fields so required-vs-optional strict parsing is
  intentional.

## Completed Foundation

The following roadmap items are complete and should not be re-added unless the
API changes:

- Sub-account limit conformance to singular `/sub-account/{handle}/limit`.
- `/check-domain` support.
- Route registry and bidirectional OpenAPI drift checks.
- Generated `docs/API_COVERAGE.md` endpoint coverage report.
- Public `mailchannels.API_SPEC_COMPATIBILITY` runtime metadata for the
  OpenAPI document targeted by the installed SDK release.
- Generated `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` public SDK reference.
- Operation-level request contract tests.
- Exact route-call matrix coverage.
- Sync/async request parity tests.
- Strict response mode and initial typed response models.
- Strict response model coverage across the modeled SDK response surface.
- Strict `/send` and `/send-async` response variant validation.
- Strict response return typing for explicit `Client(strict_responses=True)`
  callers across the modeled resource surface.
- Persistent sync and async HTTP transport client pooling with explicit close
  and context-manager lifecycle hooks.
- Directional webhook signature freshness checks with separate stale-age and
  future-skew windows.
- Full webhook digest, freshness, and RFC 9421 Ed25519 signature verification.
- Intentional destructive-operation logging lowered to info level, with warning
  reserved for unexpected recoverable behavior.
- Email payload negative tests for local validation, mocked API rejection, and
  live dry-run API rejection.
- Refined API error taxonomy.
- HTTP transport edge-case tests.
- Webhook negative helper tests.
- Manual online and destructive online test workflows.
- Consumer typing tests.
- Wheel install smoke tests.
- Coverage tooling and Python CI matrix expansion.
- README Python snippet extraction tests.
- PyPI publishing workflow.
- Focused examples for templates, unsubscribe, custom headers, DKIM,
  Cloudflare DKIM publication, sub-accounts, metrics, and existing operational
  examples.
